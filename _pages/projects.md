	<h1> Modelling and simulation of bubble dynamics near a kidney stone </h1>
	<p> The project MSBUB, funded by the ANR (grant ANR-24-CE51-0508), aims to improve the modeling of cavitation bubble dynamics in lithotripsy, where shock waves and microjets aid stone fragmentation but risk tissue damage. Existing models fail to capture the complex interplay of multiphase flow, viscoelasticity, and fluid-solid interactions. By combining high-fidelity numerical simulations with collaborative experimental research efforts, we aim to refine our understanding, optimize lithotripsy techniques, and enhance patient safety.

	<h3> Objective and scientific challenges in modelling cavitation bubble dynamics near kidney stones </h3>
	<p> The project focuses on understanding and controlling complex multiphase compressible flows in biomedical applications, particularly cavitation damage during lithotripsyâ€”a treatment for kidney stones. These flows involve violent bubble collapses induced by shock waves, laser energy, or ultrasound, leading to high-speed jets that impact nearby surfaces. Despite previous research, significant challenges remain in modelling these interactions, especially when considering multiple physical phenomena such as phase change, viscoelasticity, and solid interactions. The objective is to leverage numerical simulations to analyse these flows at spatial and temporal scales inaccessible to experiments. The work aims to advance the modelling of cavitation bubble dynamics near kidney stones by addressing key scientific and technical obstacles, including the development of visco-plastic solid models and accurate equations of state for biomaterials.

	<h3> Computational approaches and high-fidelity numerical methods for multiphase flow simulations </h3>
	<p> The project employs numerical simulations to tackle the complexities of multiphase compressible flows. It integrates high-performance computing (HPC) with ECOGEN, an open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software designed for compressible multiphase flows. ECOGEN features advanced models and numerical methods for solving flow problems involving interfaces and unsteady dynamics. The methodology involves a combination of hyperbolic system solvers and ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers to handle visco-plastic solid modelling. Additionally, the research will refine equations of state for biomaterials and optimise solvers for highly nonlinear systems. The project also emphasises improving efficiency in HPC simulations, including enhancements in adaptive mesh refinement, I/O processes, and load balancing.
