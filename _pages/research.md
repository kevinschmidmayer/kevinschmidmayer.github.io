	<h2> Diffuse-interface method </h2>
	<p> ECOGEN is a receptacle of a story of diffuse-interface method (DIM) theory that started in the late 90s.
	 DIM summarizes more than 20 years of researches on multiphase flow<sup>1</sup> modelling with the objective to develop mathematical models as well as their associated numerical methods. </p><p> What is a diffuse interface? In DIM theory, the interfaces between pure phases are captured as diffuse numerical zones meaning that one goes continuously from one phase to another. </p>

	 <p> This way is possible thanks to a thermodynamics consistency. Then, the flow solution does no longer requires interface tracking algorithms: It became easy to simulate complex topological-shape evolutions between miscible or non-miscible fluids. Moreover, pressure waves (shock waves, acoustic waves) can propagate and interact properly in the whole flow. </p><p>
	 The base research on DIM is now matured enough to propose ECOGEN, a numerical tool that can be largely cast and use to solve industrial as well as research multiphase flow problems.
