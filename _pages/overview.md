			<h1> Kevin Schmidmayer, Researcher (eq. Assis. Prof.), Inria </h1>
			<p>
				I am a permanent researcher (ISFP, eq. Assis. Prof.) at the <a href="https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-university-bordeaux" target="_blank" >Inria centre at the university of Bordeaux</a> working in the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/cagire/" target="_blank" >team CAGIRE (Pau, France)</a>. I am expert on the modelling and the simulation of multiphase compressible flows for industrial and biomedical applications:
				<ul>
					<li> Diffuse-interface methods, </li>
					<li> Bubble dynamics, </li>
					<li> Cavitation, </li>
					<li> Droplet aerobreakup, </li>
					<li> Adaptive Mesh Refinement method. </li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Since 2024, I also am a member of the <a href="https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/software-and-source-codes-college/" target="_blank" >Software and Source Codes College</a> of the Committee for Open Science from the Ministry of Higher Education and Research.

			<h2> Side note </h2>
			<p>
				Among my favourite artists, Daft Punk stand at the top. In <em>Touch</em>, they deliver a masterpiece that transcends music—a reminder of what truly matters. In a world increasingly shaped by technology and AI, we must remember what makes us human: connection, emotion, and meaning. This song whispers that even in the age of machines, love and sensitivity remain our true compass.
			</p>
			<p>
				As scientists, we push the boundaries of what is possible. Yet, <em>Touch</em> reminds us that the most profound discoveries are not just found in research, but in what it means to be human.

			<italicCenterText> Touch, touch
				I remember touch
				Where do I belong?
				Touch, I need something more
				I remember touch
				I need something more in my mind
				~
				Touch, I remember touch
				Pictures came with touch
				A painter in my mind
				Tell me what you see
				A tourist in a dream
				A visitor, it seems
				A half-forgotten song
				Where do I belong?
				Tell me what you see
				I need something more
				~
				Kiss, suddenly alive
				Happiness arrive
				Hunger like a storm
				How do I begin?
				A room within a room
				A door behind a door
				Touch, where do you lead?
				I need something more
				Tell me what you see
				I need something more
				~
				Home, hold on, if love is the answer, you're home
				Hold on, if love is the answer, you're home (x6)
				Hold on, if love is the answer, you're–
				~
				Touch, sweet touch
				You've given me too much to feel
				Sweet touch
				You've almost convinced me I'm real
				I need something more
				I need something more
			</italicCenterText>
			<p>
				Let’s innovate with purpose, and never lose sight of the human touch. Because humanity isn’t coded—it’s felt.
